    "As the TextBlob sentiment scorer was not trained on out data and is based on preset rules, we would like to see if we can improve our polarity scores by creating a custom model. We searched for labeled datasets that contained similar information to our reviews but were unable to find one. Due to this constraint, we decided to explore unsupervised algorithms. Many of the recent NLP algorithms use embeddings to classify the words/sentences/documents, so we decided to employ this strategy as well. We then aim to classify these vector embeddings with k-means clustering and generate a polarity score from the euclidean distance to the cluster centroids. "

It felt absolutely comfortable, and - dare I say? - luxurious.  The studio is perfectly located between downtown Austin and Austin's fun and hip Soco neighborhood.  If you're coming to Austin for SXSW, you'll be perfectly located (an easy 15 minute walk to the Convention Center) and you'll find that this place offers a lovely, peaceful respite from the fast-paced and frenzied SXSW environment.  Todd and Amy were very gracious hosts, helping me get settled in and answering all my \"Austin newbie\" queries.  They even set me up with some coffee beans and tea upon my (Website hidden by Airbnb) the little things!  They're glad to share their awesome city with others, and you'll be happy to have them as a resource during your stay. \n"
