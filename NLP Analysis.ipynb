The space is clean and efficient. One thing to keep in mind is the toilet seat is on a 1 foot high pedestal. The shower is also on an 8-inch pedestal and it's super tiny.

The public bus stop is less than a block from the condo as well.  I drove my car so I also appreciated the covered parking.  The neighbors were friendly, but politely quite.
